<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a passionate and dedicated individual with a strong interest in building impactful digital solutions. I take pride in blending creativity with technical skills to develop applications that are both functional and user-friendly. Over time, I've worked on meaningful projects involving smart traffic systems, secure password management, and blockchain-based tracking, always focusing on real-world usefulness.

  <p>
    I thrive in solving problems, exploring new ideas, and continuously pushing my limits. Whether it's building full-stack applications, working with AI models, or designing smooth user experiences, I enjoy bringing ideas to life through code. I'm also a consistent and disciplined person — someone who believes in showing up every day, improving bit by bit.

  <p>
    Outside of tech, I’m passionate about fitness and personal development. I follow a regular workout routine, believe in balance, and always aim to give my best in everything I do. I value growth, consistency, and making meaningful contributions wherever I am.
